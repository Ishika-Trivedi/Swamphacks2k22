## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Today's era of healthcare system has a very big ILL impact due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various circumstances.<br />
üìç Diseases that can be noticed easily , pass unnoticed, which in turn contribute to a bigger health hazard.<br />
üìç In various conditions it is impossible to have manual check in regular time interval if the patient‚Äôs condition is becoming worse in between then it creates a emergency situation.<br />
üìç Risk assessment for any disease/ medical condition can be estimated and changes in regular lifestyle can be made accordingly.<br />
üìç Poor health monitoring can cause a case of denial for the disease in case of ‚Äúsudden‚Äù appearance of the disease.<br />
üìç It can also psychologically effect patient as he might be scared that a disease would pop up if he goes for a checkup.<br />
üìç Regular health checks can identify any early signs of health issues.<br />
üìç Prompt you to maintain a healthy lifestyle.<br />
üìç When you have a check, your doctor will talk to you about your medical history, your family‚Äôs history of disease and your lifestyle. Your diet, weight, how much you exercise, and whether or not you smoke and drink alcohol or take illegal drugs will also be discussed.<br />
üìç If you have high-risk factors, such as a family history of a condition, it may be more likely that you will develop a particular disease. Regular checks may help your doctor pick up early warning signs.<br />

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project greatly increases the efficiency of the hospital staff as a whole. The pandemic has led to a lot of hospitals being completely occupied, and the hospital staff overwhelmed. By not having to conduct manual routine checks on the drip levels , drip conditions , Temperature , heartbeat, oxygen rate and Blood pressure of every patient, the workload of the hospital staff is exceedingly diminished. Automation in such essential tasks is the next step towards providing more efficient and convenient healthcare.

The device and sensor‚Äôs data will be transferred to arduino and arduino in turn sends that data to cloud and from the database the data will be fetched and to the application and will be used and stored to generate reports.

## THE DRIP MONITORING SYSTEM

This system elaborates a way to efficiently monitor the drip level at hospitals, while also detecting any bubble formation in the liquid used; a process that is currently done manually by nurses when they periodically check the drip.

Hardware Requirements and Arrangement:
1.Arduino Uno
2. HCSR-04 Ultrasonic sensor
3. Photo-resistor/light sensor
4. Light source
5. Esp8266-01 Wifi module

The Arduino Uno is connected to the ESP8266 module, and two sensors(HCSR04 and the LDR). The Ultrasonic sensor has been attached to the bottom of an inverted plastic bottle, which is acting as a drip for demonstration purposes. The LDR has been tucked away inside the bottlecap. The sensor data is fetched and calculated using the Arduino Uno. The calculated sensor values are conveyed to the Thingspeak website via the ESP8266 module.

## Working : 

<img width="527" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693201-cdfff42a-6e50-447d-a687-4e2c669946ee.png">

The block diagram above represents the correct working of the model in that first it will measure the level of solution left in the bottle through the ultrasonic sensor and if there are any bubbles formed in that solution and due to which there is an obstacle in the path of flowing the solution through a drip that will be detected by the LDR(light dependent resistor). The data produced by the ultrasonic and LDR will be sent to the firebase through that again it will be sent to the Mobile APP and according to the data received by app, there will certain warnings that whether the solution is about to finish or if there are any bubbles formed in that solution or not.

## JEEVANREKHA APPLICATION:

<img width="657" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693251-86ce11a4-b6a0-4a49-974d-2ab088404c23.png">

JeevanRekha application will be an IOS application having all the features as described and in future this application will be also available in other operating systems. It will allows to create account and do log in for different type of users.

While creating an account it will ask for the profile type of the user , if the user is a doctor and a staff he or she will be verified and validated then the person will be a registered user and can log in and run the application.

<img width="223" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693412-881bb518-8ca1-47db-8015-5429a1bc462f.png">

Under the Patient details where we can find search bar where we can search by patient name and patient id The indicator shows the status of the patient.
üí•Red indicates patient's report shows its emergency and need doctor immediately.
üí•Orange indicates intermediate stage needs staff monitoring.
üí•Green indicates Patient's reports are safe.

<img width="204" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693426-6a9a2494-357a-46c4-972d-e5af5be6a296.png">

By clicking any profile in the patient detail page user will be directed to this patient information page. After opening brief details of each patient user can view various health status of the patient and also by clicking on patient profile you check the patient profile which will contain previous records.

The proposed solution is going to help the hospital staff in a very fruitful manner through which they need not visit the patient's room repeatedly just for checking the usefull infromation and also notify to doctors and staffs in emergency situation directly. We have successfully solved this problem in a virtual format using IoT

## OXYGEN LEVEL MONITORING SYSTEM

Why do we need to check a patient's oxygen level?
Pulse oximetry is a test used to measure the oxygen level (oxygen saturation) of the blood. It is an easy, painless measure of how well oxygen is being sent to parts of your body furthest from your heart, such as the arms and legs.
During or after surgery or procedures that use sedation
üßä To see how well lung medicines are working
üßä To check a person‚Äôs ability to handle increased activity levels
üßä To see if a ventilator is needed to help with breathing, or to see how well it‚Äôs working
üßä To check a person has moments when breathing stops during sleep (sleep apnea)

How do we check manually?
A clip-like device called a probe is placed on a body part, such as a finger or ear lobe. The probe uses light to measure how much oxygen is in the blood. The probe may be left on for ongoing monitoring. Or it may be used to take a single reading. The probe will be removed after the test.

Advantages:-
ü™Å Monitoring oxygen saturation over time
ü™Å Alerting to dangerously low oxygen levels, particularly in new-borns.
ü™Å Offering peace of mind to people with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions
ü™Å Assessing the need for supplemental oxygen
ü™Å Monitoring oxygen saturation levels in people under anaesthesia.
ü™Å Indicating dangerous side effects in people taking drugs that affect breathing or oxygen saturation.

Implementation:
MAX30100 is an integrated pulse oximeter and heart-rate monitor sensor solution. It‚Äôs an optical sensor that derives its readings from emitting two wavelengths of light from two
LEDs ‚Äì a red and an infrared one

<img width="304" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693541-522206b9-7add-45cb-aa22-8cdad11506a4.png">

‚Äì then measuring the absorbance of pulsing blood through a photodetector. This particular LED colour combination is optimized for reading the data through the tip of one‚Äôs finger. It is fully configurable through software registers and the digital output data is stored in a 16-deep FIFO within the device. It has an I2C digital interface to communicate with a host microcontroller. This sensor will be connected to Arduino and the data received from the sensor will be received in the Arduino.

## BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE RATE MONITORING SYSTEM

Why should we need to check a patient's blood pressure?
Measuring our blood pressure regularly will help our health care team to diagnose any health problems in the early stage. Then we can take steps to control your blood pressure if it is too high or too low. Measuring our blood pressure is the only way to know whether we have high blood
pressure or low blood pressure.
If we are diagnosed with high blood pressure, we can comply with medications to treat it. Untreated high blood pressure leads to stroke, heart attack, kidney failure and heart failure. We should get our blood pressure checked regularly because high blood pressure is a silent killer. There are often no symptoms of this potentially deadly condition.

Advantage:-
Blood pressure monitoring is an important way of diagnosing hypertension and your cardiovascular health. Doing it allows doctors to carry out additional checks that are useful in evaluating the progress of the blood pressure, using diagnostic plans laid down by the European Society of Hypertension.

Implementation:-
Pulse Sensor is a low cost, very small size a plug-and-play heart rate sensor for Arduino and Arduino compatible boards. It is an optical heart rate sensor measures pulse waves, which are changes in the volume of a blood vessel that occur when the heart pumps blood. Pulse waves are detected by measuring the change in volume using an optical sensor and green LED.

<img width="189" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151693982-a76ec0b1-0dff-41dc-97c7-d82a8a1b33bd.png">

Pulse sensors using the photoelectric pulse wave method are classified into 2 types depending on the measurement method: transmission and reflection. Transmission types measure pulse waves by emitting red or infrared light from the body surface and detecting the change in blood flow during heart beats as a change in the amount of light transmitted through the body. This method is limited to areas where light can easily penetrate, such as the fingertip or earlobe.
Reflection-type pulse sensors (Optical Sensors for Heart Rate Monitor) emit infrared, red, or green light (~550nm) towards the body and measure the amount of light reflected using a photodiode or phototransistor.
Oxygenated haemoglobin present in the blood of the arteries has the characteristic of absorbing incident light, so by sensing the blood flow rate (change in blood vessel volume) that changes following heart contractions over time we are able to measure the pulse wave signal.

## CARDIAC MONITORING SYSTEM:

Why should we need to check a patient's Cardiogram data?
An electrocardiogram(ECG) is a simple test that can be used to
check the heart‚Äôs rhythm and electrical activity.
It can be used to investigate symptoms of a possible heart problem
such as chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
An ECG can help you detect:
o Arrhythmias- where the heart beats too slowly, too quickly, or
too irregularly.
o Coronary heart disease- where the heart‚Äôs blood supply is
blocked or interrupted by a build-up of fatty substances.
o Heart attacks-where the supply of the blood to the heart is
suddenly blocked.
o Cardiomyopathy-where the heart wall become thickened or
enlarged.
All of the diseases are either fatal on their own or can lead some
chronic problem.

Implementation

An ECG can be implemented
through AD8232 ECG
Monitor Sensor Module(
shown in the picture above)
This is a cost-effective ECG
sensor used to measure the
electrical activity of the heart.
This electrical activity can be
charted as an ECG or
electrocardiogram and output
as an analog reading.
The AD8232 module breaks out nine connections from the IC that
you can solder pins, wires, or other connectors to. SDN, LO+, LO-,
OUTPUT, 3.3V, GND provide essential pins for operating this
monitor with an Arduino or other development board. Also provided
on this board are RA (Right Arm), LA (Left Arm), and RL (Right Leg)
pins to attach and use your own custom sensors. Additionally, there
is an LED indicator light that will pulsate to the rhythm of a heartbeat.
This sensor will be connected to the Arduino and all the data will be
fetched into it and all the data sent to cloud and it is converted to
proper graphical format.

## TEMPRATURE MONITORING SYSTEM

A temperature monitoring system has become an essential part of
healthcare, hospitals, clinics, food business, and other industries in
recent years.
Measuring body temperature is very important in medicine. A number
of diseases are characterised by a change in body temperature. With
other illnesses, the course of the disease can be followed by
measuring body temperature. This allows the doctor to analyse the
effectiveness of treatments based on body temperatures.
A fever is the reaction to a disease-specific stimuli. The body changes
its normal temperature to support the body‚Äôs own defence
mechanisms. Fever is the most common form of disease-related
(pathological) increase in body temperature.
By understanding your own individual body temperature, noticing
changes that might indicate an infection, and taking immediate
measures to prevent spreading it to others, you can help family,
friends, and co-workers stay safe, healthy, and productive.

Implementation:

The MLX90614 ESF is an Infra-Red thermometer for non-contact
temperature measurements. Both the IR sensitive thermopile detector
chip and the signal conditioning ASIC are integrated into the same TO39 can. The Integrated MLX90614 GY-906 is a low noise amplifier, 17-
bit ADC, and powerful DSP unit thus achieving high accuracy and
resolution of the thermometer.
The user can configure the digital output to be PWM. As a standard, the
10-bit PWM is configured to continuously transmit the measured
temperature in the range of -20 to 120 C, with an output resolution of
0.14 C.
This sensor will be connected to the Arduino and all the data will be
fetched into it and all the data sent to cloud

## ARDUINO UNO 

<img width="301" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151694520-53ba4790-63a3-4854-89ba-53633e4debc9.png">

Arduino Uno is a microcontroller
board based on the ATmega328P
(datasheet). It has 14 digital
input/output pins (of which 6 can
be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog
inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic
resonator (CSTCE16M0V53-R0), a
USB connection, a power jack, an
ICSP header, and a reset button. It
contains everything needed to
support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB
cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started. You
can tinker with your Uno without worrying too much about doing
something wrong, in the worst-case scenario you can replace the chip
for a few dollars and start over again.

## Esp8266 NodeMcu

<img width="310" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76068886/151694537-fe928001-e6d6-4c1e-95a8-30ac2efd080c.png">

The ESP8266 WIFI Module is a self-contained SOC with an integrated
TCP/IP protocol stack that can give any microcontroller access to your
WIFI network. The ESP8266 is capable of either hosting an application
or offloading all WIFI networking functions from another application
processor. Each ESP8266 module comes pre-programmed with an AT
command set firmware, meaning,
you can simply hook this up to your
Arduino device and get about as
much WIFI-ability as a WIFI Shield
offers (and that's just out of the box)!
The ESP8266 module is an
extremely cost-effective board with
a huge, and ever-growing,
community.
This module has a powerful enough onboard processing and storage
capability that allows it to be integrated with the sensors and other
application-specific devices through its GPIOs with minimal
development up-front and minimal loading during runtime. Its high
degree of on-chip integration allows for minimal external circuitry,
including the front-end module, which is designed to occupy a minimal
PCB area. The ESP8266 supports APSD for VoIP applications and
Bluetooth co-existence interfaces, it contains a self-calibrated RF
allowing it to work under all operating conditions and requires no
external RF parts.

How do the Sensors Works with Arduino and Nodemcu?
To each and every sensor, a supply of +5v/3.3v and Gnd is provided by
the Arduino, and the digital data incoming pins of all the sensors are
connected to digital input pins of Arduino which in turn Arduino sends all
the incoming data received by sensors to the node MCU which is
connected to Rx and Tx pins of the Arduino (Here Rx is Data Receiving
pin and Tx is Data Transmitting Pin) so the data received by Arduino is
sent to the Node MCU which is connected to the internet which in turn
sends the data to the Google firebase from where we can fetch all the data
to our Mobile application.
The mobile application is developed using swift and it‚Äôs an IOS based app
that will collect every information regarding the patient.

## Business Model

What product/service do we provide?<br />
Primarily, our product provides support to measurements of a person‚Äôs drip level,
bp, oxygen level and provide the user with an accurate ECG graph.
This product is linked with our app allowing one to monitor the details generated
through his/her phone. This will also allow the doctor in charge of multiple patients
to monitor the readings simultaneously and alert the user in case the reading goes
beyond the boundaries considered healthy.<br />
Whom do we intend to market that product or service?<br />
‚òÅÔ∏è We are intent to market our product to hospitals so that they can save time on
monitoring patients. The number of patients for whom each doctor/nurse is
responsible will also be increased.
‚òÅÔ∏è We also intend to market it to those who have someone ill enough that they
need to be under observation constantly like a family member or a caretaker so
that they can be informed when the vitals are going out of the green zone<br />
How do we intend to market it?<br />
We plan to market it as software responsible for bringing all the data regarding a
person under one device. This software will also allow users to monitor multiple
subjects at the same time why notifying the user in case the subject‚Äôs vitals are not
in green.
