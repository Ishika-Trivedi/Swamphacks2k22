# IOT tool to monitor patients health remotely 
## ABSTRACT:-
Today's era of the healthcare system has a very big ILL impact due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various circumstances.Regular health checks can identify any early signs of health issues and prompt us to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our goal is to provide the users with an improved form of healthcare facilities at a reasonable cost that has faster disease diagnosis, proactive treatment and error reduction. Keeping all that in mind we introduce you to the iOS-based app, Jeevan-Rekha. Jeevan Rekha will allow any medical
staff, doctor to view their patient’s information and current health
status and reports. Family members of the patient also can view
various useful data. Doctors and staff will get a notification when the
reports will show any critical situation which will help to save the
lives of different patients in an emergency situation. It also helps in
the collection of data on a patients’ drip level, oxygen saturation
level, pulse rate, etc. The idea is implemented by sending sensor's
and device data to clouds and fetching those data to our application
and using those data to show and record it for future purposes.
This project is designed to greatly increase the efficiency of the
hospital staff as a whole. By not having to conduct manual routine
checks on the drip levels, drip
conditions, Temperature, heartbeat, oxygen rate and Blood pressure
of every patient, the workload of the hospital staff is exceedingly
diminished. Thus, automation is an essential step towards providing
more efficient, effective and convenient healthcare facilities to all.
Today's era of healthcare system has a very big ILL impact
due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various
circumstances.
• Diseases that can be noticed easily , pass unnoticed, which
in turn contribute to a bigger health hazard.
• In various conditions it is impossible to have manual check
in regular time interval if the patient’s condition is
becoming worse in between then it creates a emergency
situation.
• Risk assessment for any disease/ medical condition can be
estimated and changes in regular lifestyle can be made
accordingly
• Poor health monitoring can cause a case of denial for the
disease in case of “sudden” appearance of the disease.
• It can also psychologically effect patient as he might be
scared that a disease would pop up if he goes for a
checkup.

##PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Today's era of healthcare system has a very big ILL impact
due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various
circumstances.
• Diseases that can be noticed easily , pass unnoticed, which
in turn contribute to a bigger health hazard.
• In various conditions it is impossible to have manual check
in regular time interval if the patient’s condition is
becoming worse in between then it creates a emergency
situation.
• Risk assessment for any disease/ medical condition can be
estimated and changes in regular lifestyle can be made
accordingly
• Poor health monitoring can cause a case of denial for the
disease in case of “sudden” appearance of the disease.
• It can also psychologically effect patient as he might be
scared that a disease would pop up if he goes for a
checkup.
• Regular health checks can identify any early signs of health
issues.
• prompt you to maintain a healthy lifestyle
• When you have a check, your doctor will talk to you about
your medical history, your family’s history of disease and your
lifestyle. Your diet, weight, how much you exercise, and
whether or not you smoke and drink alcohol or take illegal
drugs will also be discussed.
• If you have high-risk factors, such as a family history of a
condition, it may be more likely that you will develop a
particular disease. Regular checks may help your doctor pick
up early warning signs.

## OUR GOAL
• Cost Reduction: IoT enables patient monitoring in real time,
thus significantly cutting down unnecessary visits to doctors,
hospital stays and re-admissions
• Improved Treatment: It enables physicians to make evidencebased informed decisions and brings absolute transparency
• Faster Disease Diagnosis: Continuous patient monitoring and
real time data helps in diagnosing diseases at an early stage or
even before the disease develops based on symptoms
• Proactive Treatment: Continuous health monitoring opens the
doors for providing proactive medical treatment
• Drugs and Equipment Management: Management of drugs
and medical equipment is a major challenge in a healthcare
industry. Through connected devices, these are managed and
utilized efficiently with reduced costs
• Error Reduction: Data generated through IoT devices not only
help in effective decision making but also ensure smooth
healthcare operations with reduced errors, waste and system
costs 

## OUR SOLUTION
 We are introducing an IOS based application which is
JeevanRekha.
• JevanRekha will allow any medical staff, doctor to view
their patient’s information and current health status and
reports.
• Family members of the patient also can view various
useful data .
• Doctors and staffs will get a notification when the reports
will show any critical situation which will helps to save
the lives of different patient in emergency situation.
• We are collecting data of
• Drip level
• Oxygen saturation level
• Pulse rate
• Electrocardiogram data (optional)
We will implement our idea by sending sensor's and
device data to clouds and fetch those data to our
application and use those data to show and record it for
future purpose.

##PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project greatly increases the efficiency of the hospital
staff as a whole. The pandemic has led to a lot of hospitals
being completely occupied, and the hospital staff
overwhelmed. By not having to conduct manual routine
checks on the drip levels , drip conditions , Temperature ,
heartbeat, oxygen rate and Blood pressure of every patient,
the workload of the hospital staff is exceedingly diminished.
Automation in such essential tasks is the next step towards
providing more efficient and convenient healthcare.

The device and sensor’s
data will be transferred to to
arduino and arduino in turn
sends that data to cloud
and from the database the
data will be fetched and to
the application and will be
used and stored to generate
reports.
