# IOT tool to monitor patients health remotely 
## ABSTRACT:-
Today's era of the healthcare system has a very big ILL impact due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various circumstances.Regular health checks can identify any early signs of health issues and prompt us to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our goal is to provide the users with an improved form of healthcare facilities at a reasonable cost that has faster disease diagnosis, proactive treatment and error reduction. Keeping all that in mind we introduce you to the iOS-based app, Jeevan-Rekha. Jeevan Rekha will allow any medical
staff, doctor to view their patient’s information and current health
status and reports. Family members of the patient also can view
various useful data. Doctors and staff will get a notification when the
reports will show any critical situation which will help to save the
lives of different patients in an emergency situation. It also helps in
the collection of data on a patients’ drip level, oxygen saturation
level, pulse rate, etc. The idea is implemented by sending sensor's
and device data to clouds and fetching those data to our application
and using those data to show and record it for future purposes.
This project is designed to greatly increase the efficiency of the
hospital staff as a whole. By not having to conduct manual routine
checks on the drip levels, drip
conditions, Temperature, heartbeat, oxygen rate and Blood pressure
of every patient, the workload of the hospital staff is exceedingly
diminished. Thus, automation is an essential step towards providing
more efficient, effective and convenient healthcare facilities to all.
Today's era of healthcare system has a very big ILL impact
due to poor health monitoring of patients due to various
circumstances.
• Diseases that can be noticed easily , pass unnoticed, which
in turn contribute to a bigger health hazard.
• In various conditions it is impossible to have manual check
in regular time interval if the patient’s condition is
becoming worse in between then it creates a emergency
situation.
• Risk assessment for any disease/ medical condition can be
estimated and changes in regular lifestyle can be made
accordingly
• Poor health monitoring can cause a case of denial for the
disease in case of “sudden” appearance of the disease.
• It can also psychologically effect patient as he might be
scared that a disease would pop up if he goes for a
checkup.
